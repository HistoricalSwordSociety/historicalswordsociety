<section id="khopesh" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Khopesh (c. 1800–800 BCE)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The khopesh represents one of the earliest purpose-designed military swords.
        Developed during the Bronze Age, its forward-curving, axe-like profile reflects
        the material limitations of bronze metallurgy, which favored chopping power over
        fine thrusting durability. The inward hook allowed the blade to shear through
        shields, trap limbs, and deliver decisive cleaving blows against lightly armored
        opponents.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        No formal fencing manuals survive from this period. Training methods are inferred
        from Egyptian reliefs and temple carvings dating to the New Kingdom, including
        depictions at Karnak and Medinet Habu. Combat emphasized shield control, forward
        momentum, and close-range dominance rather than extended exchanges or refined
        point work.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern reconstruction focuses on rotational cutting mechanics, edge alignment,
        and the integration of shield and sword as a single fighting system. At HSS, the
        khopesh is taught as a foundational study in how metallurgy directly shaped early
        weapon design and tactical doctrine.
    </p>

<section id="xiphos" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Greek Xiphos & Early Iron Short Swords (c. 800–300 BCE)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The transition from bronze to iron metallurgy enabled narrower, stronger blades
        capable of effective thrusting. The Greek xiphos evolved as a secondary weapon to
        the spear, optimized for close-in fighting once formations collapsed. Its leaf-shaped
        profile balanced cutting and thrusting, reflecting early experimentation with iron
        blade geometry.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        No surviving fencing treatises exist from Classical Greece. Knowledge of sword use
        derives from archaeological finds, painted pottery, and written accounts by authors
        such as Herodotus. Training emphasized formation cohesion, shield dominance, and
        disciplined movement rather than individual dueling skill.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        HEMA reconstruction focuses on constrained-space fencing, thrust mechanics at close
        measure, and the transition from spear to sword within formation-based combat.
        Instruction emphasizes how early iron technology expanded tactical possibilities.
    </p>

<section id="gladius" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Roman Gladius (c. 300 BCE–300 CE)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The Roman gladius represents one of history’s most purpose-built military swords.
        Short, rigid, and acutely pointed, it was optimized for thrusting within tight
        formations. Advances in iron and early steel production allowed Roman blades to
        maintain structural integrity under repeated impact, enabling lethal penetration
        into unarmored gaps while preserving formation discipline.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Roman training doctrine is described in the military writings of Vegetius,
        particularly <em>De Re Militari</em>. Soldiers trained extensively with weighted
        practice weapons, prioritizing thrusts over cuts for efficiency, endurance, and
        battlefield survivability. Sword use was inseparable from shield control and unit
        cohesion.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern instruction emphasizes centerline control, structural alignment, and
        economical motion. At HSS, the gladius is taught as a study in tactical restraint,
        illustrating how doctrine and discipline can outweigh individual flair.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="falcata" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Falcata (c. 500–200 BCE)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The falcata was wielded by Iberian warriors and became infamous during Rome’s
        campaigns in Hispania. Its forward-curving, forward-weighted blade delivered
        exceptional cutting power, capable of defeating Roman shields and helmets.
        Superior Iberian steel-working techniques allowed harder edges and more resilient
        blades than those commonly encountered by Roman forces.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        No fencing manuals survive from Iberian cultures of this period. Roman historical
        accounts by Polybius and Livy describe the shock effect and destructive capability
        of Iberian swords against legionaries. Training emphasized aggressive forward
        pressure, decisive cuts, and close-range combat supported by shield use.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern reconstruction emphasizes cutting mechanics driven by forward mass
        distribution, edge alignment, and rotational power. At HSS, falcata study highlights
        how blade geometry can compensate for limited thrusting capability.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="spatha" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Roman Spatha (c. 200–600 CE)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The spatha evolved as Roman warfare shifted away from dense infantry formations
        toward increased cavalry use and more fluid battlefield conditions. Longer than
        the gladius, the spatha provided extended reach and improved cutting capability
        while retaining effective thrusting performance. Its design foreshadows early
        medieval sword forms.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Late Roman military practices, as described by Vegetius, indicate continued
        emphasis on disciplined training and repetition. The spatha saw extensive use
        among cavalry units, requiring broader cutting mechanics and adaptability to
        mounted combat.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        In HEMA study, the spatha is treated as a transitional weapon bridging classical
        Roman and early medieval fencing concepts. Training emphasizes reach management,
        cutting mechanics, and the evolution of sword length in response to tactical need.
    </p>

<section id="viking-sword" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Viking Sword (c. 750–1050)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        Viking swords represent the refinement of early medieval steelworking, often
        utilizing pattern-welded construction to balance resilience and cutting power.
        Broad blades with pronounced fullers allowed effective cuts against lightly
        armored opponents while maintaining manageable weight for prolonged combat.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        No formal fencing manuals survive from the Viking Age. Knowledge of sword use is
        derived from archaeological evidence and narrative sources such as the Icelandic
        sagas, including <em>Njáls Saga</em> and <em>Heimskringla</em>. Training was pragmatic
        and experience-driven, emphasizing shield integration and decisive blows.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        HEMA reconstruction focuses on shield-sword coordination, rotational cutting
        mechanics, and close-range exchanges. At HSS, Viking sword training emphasizes
        tactical aggression tempered by control and structure.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="arming-sword" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Arming Sword (c. 1000–1350)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The arming sword refined earlier Viking forms into a knightly sidearm suited to
        a world dominated by mail and emerging plate defenses. Improvements in steel and
        heat treatment supported more acute points and stronger distal taper, enabling
        effective thrusting into gaps while preserving credible cutting power.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Early European fencing doctrine appears in the manuscript commonly known as
        <em>I.33</em> (c. 1300), a foundational source for sword-and-buckler play. It presents
        structured lessons emphasizing guards (custodiae), binding, timing, and tactical
        decision-making. Period training integrated weapon use with grappling and shield
        control depending on context.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern HEMA instruction develops the arming sword as a core curriculum weapon,
        introducing measure, leverage, and bind work that later expands into longsword
        and sidesword systems. At HSS, training includes both solo structure drills and
        paired tactical exercises.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="falchion" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Falchion (c. 1200–1500)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The falchion represents a specialization toward cutting dominance during the High
        Medieval period. Single-edged construction, often with forward-weighted blades,
        optimized the weapon for powerful blows capable of damaging mail armor and
        exploiting unprotected targets. Its form reflects an intentional tradeoff:
        sacrificing refined thrusting for decisive cutting force.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        While no dedicated falchion fencing manual survives, the weapon appears frequently
        in period artwork such as the <em>Maciejowski Bible</em> (c. 1250). Its use is inferred
        from contemporary arming sword and messer traditions, emphasizing committed cuts,
        strong structure, and aggressive initiative.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        HEMA falchion practice focuses on edge alignment, leverage, and momentum management.
        At HSS, falchion training highlights how blade mass distribution influences tactical
        decision-making and cutting efficiency.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="longsword" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Longsword (c. 1350–1600)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The longsword evolved in parallel with the widespread adoption of plate armor.
        Longer blades, extended grips, and acute points enabled a highly versatile weapon
        capable of powerful cuts, precise thrusts, half-swording, and grappling techniques.
        Its design reflects a technological response to hardened defenses and increasingly
        sophisticated martial systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Longsword fencing is extensively documented in late medieval martial manuscripts.
        The German tradition attributed to Johannes Liechtenauer appears in texts such as
        MS 3227a, while the Italian tradition is preserved in Fiore dei Liberi’s
        <em>Fior di Battaglia</em>. These sources emphasize timing (tempo), distance (measure),
        binding, and tactical decision-making in both armored and unarmored contexts.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Longsword remains a cornerstone of modern HEMA. At HSS, instruction integrates
        historical drills with modern training methods, focusing on timing, structure,
        adaptability, and controlled intensity across paired and free-play exercises.
    </p>

<section id="montante" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Montante / Zweihänder (c. 1500–1650)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        Greatswords such as the montante and zweihänder evolved to control space on crowded
        battlefields, disrupt pike formations, and protect high-value personnel. Their size
        and leverage allowed wide arcs of attack and strong defensive coverage, reflecting
        battlefield requirements rather than civilian dueling norms.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Iberian greatsword methods are preserved in dedicated sources, including Domingo
        Luis Godinho’s <em>Arte de Esgrima</em> (1599) and Diogo Gomes de Figueyredo’s
        <em>Oplosophia</em> (mid-17th century). These works emphasize continuous motion,
        structured “rules” or sequences, and the tactical use of reach and momentum to
        dominate multiple lines of approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern HEMA practice commonly teaches montante through flow drills that develop
        endurance, footwork discipline, spatial awareness, and safe power generation.
        At HSS, montante training is presented as an applied study in space control and
        tactical movement under pressure.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="rapier" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Rapier (c. 1500–1700)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The rapier emerged in response to declining battlefield armor and the rise of
        civilian self-defense and judicial dueling. Long, narrow blades with complex hilts
        prioritized thrusting precision and point control over heavy cutting power. Advances
        in steel production enabled blades capable of extreme length without sacrificing
        structural integrity.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Rapier fencing is extensively documented in Renaissance treatises. Key sources
        include Camillo Agrippa’s <em>Trattato di Scientia d’Arme</em> (1553), Ridolfo Capo
        Ferro’s <em>Gran Simulacro</em> (1610), and Salvator Fabris’ <em>Lo Schermo</em> (1606).
        These works emphasize geometry, measure, timing, and control of the opponent’s blade
        through opposition and engagement.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern HEMA rapier instruction preserves the intellectual and technical character
        of historical fencing. At HSS, training emphasizes point dominance, tactical patience,
        and historically grounded decision-making through structured drills and free fencing.

<section id="sidesword-broadsword" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Sidesword / Broadsword (c. 1450–1700)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The sidesword and early broadsword traditions reflect a transitional period where
        both cut and thrust remained tactically relevant. As armor declined in civilian life
        but persisted in military contexts, these swords preserved robust cutting ability
        while maintaining credible point work. Hilts became increasingly protective, evolving
        toward complex guards and baskets to support extended hand-forward engagements.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Italian cut-and-thrust systems are documented in works such as Antonio Manciolino’s
        <em>Opera Nova</em> (1531) and Achille Marozzo’s <em>Opera Nova</em> (1536). These sources
        emphasize structured guards, tempo, and combined arms pairings (buckler, dagger, cape),
        reflecting the realities of both civic defense and battlefield sidearm use.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern HEMA training treats sidesword as a core transitional discipline, developing
        adaptive decision-making across cut and thrust. At HSS, instruction commonly integrates
        paired-weapon options and tactical problem sets derived from the period sources.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="small-sword" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Small Sword (c. 1650–1800)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The small sword represents the culmination of civilian thrust-centric fencing.
        As armor disappeared from personal combat, blades became lighter, narrower, and
        optimized exclusively for the thrust. Cutting capacity was intentionally abandoned
        in favor of speed, precision, and refined point control. This technological shift
        reflects social as well as martial evolution, aligning swordsmanship with etiquette
        and formalized dueling conventions.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Small sword fencing is well documented in French and Italian sources of the late
        seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Notable treatises include works by Domenico
        Angelo, whose methods emphasized posture, linear footwork, and controlled extension.
        These systems formalized many principles that would later define modern sport fencing.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        In modern HEMA practice, small sword is taught as a precision discipline focused on
        timing, distance, and tactical subtlety. At HSS, instruction highlights its direct
        influence on contemporary fencing pedagogy and its role as a technological endpoint
        of the rapier tradition.

<section id="shamshir" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Shamshir / Scimitar (c. 900–1800)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        Deeply curved swords such as the shamshir evolved in regions where mounted warfare
        remained central. Curvature optimized the draw cut, allowing effective cutting while
        passing at speed on horseback. This reflects a tactical adaptation: instead of driving
        a point through armor, these swords exploited mobility, timing, and slicing mechanics
        against lightly armored targets.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        While the Islamic world preserves many military and horsemanship writings, surviving
        sources relevant to sword use are often embedded within broader treatises on warfare
        and cavalry skills rather than stand-alone fencing manuals. Practical instruction is
        also evidenced through Persian miniature traditions and Ottoman military culture.
        Period training emphasized cutting from motion, wrist-edge control, and the ability
        to generate reliable draw cuts under cavalry conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern reconstruction emphasizes curved-blade cutting physics, edge alignment across
        an arc, and tactical movement consistent with cavalry-derived mechanics. At HSS, this
        study is framed as a parallel technological branch: a different solution set shaped by
        mobility and operational context rather than plate-armor defeat.

<section id="cutlass" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Cutlass (c. 1650–1850)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The cutlass emerged as a utilitarian naval weapon designed for close-quarters combat
        aboard ships. Shorter blade length, moderate curvature, and robust construction made
        it effective in confined spaces and resilient under harsh maritime conditions. Its
        design reflects industrial-age pragmatism rather than aristocratic or dueling culture.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Cutlass use is documented in British and European naval drill manuals of the
        eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Training emphasized aggression, simplicity,
        and reliability, focusing on decisive cuts, basic parries, and rapid engagement at
        close range rather than refined fencing theory.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        In modern HEMA contexts, cutlass fencing is often taught alongside military sabre.
        At HSS, instruction focuses on close-quarters tactics, durability-oriented blade
        handling, and the relationship between naval weapons and later sabre systems.

<section id="sabre" class="main">
    <header class="major">
        <h2>Sabre (c. 1700–1900)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The sabre evolved from earlier curved cavalry swords as firearms reduced the
        prevalence of heavy armor. Designed for speed, reach, and effective cutting from
        horseback, sabres balanced curvature with sufficient point geometry to allow
        thrusting when required. National variations reflect differing cavalry doctrines
        and battlefield priorities.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Sabre fencing is well documented in military manuals across Europe, including
        Hungarian, French, Polish, and British traditions. These sources emphasize initiative,
        speed, cutting lines, and aggressive tempo, often prioritizing offensive action over
        prolonged defensive exchanges.

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern HEMA sabre integrates historical military sources with contemporary training
        methods. At HSS, sabre instruction focuses on timing, cutting mechanics, and tactical
        decision-making derived from cavalry doctrine while remaining adaptable to foot combat.

        <h2>Russian Shashka (c. 1800–present)</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Historical & Technological Context</h3>
    <p>
        The shashka represents a late-stage evolution of the cavalry sabre, optimized for
        speed, cutting efficiency, and continuous motion. Characterized by minimal or absent
        hand guards and pronounced curvature, it reflects a design philosophy favoring fluid,
        instinctive cutting over complex defensive structures. Its form was well suited to
        fast-moving cavalry engagements and irregular warfare.
    </p>

    <h3>Period Training & Use (Sources)</h3>
    <p>
        Shashka use is documented through Cossack military tradition, Imperial Russian cavalry
        regulations, and oral transmission rather than formal fencing treatises. Training
        emphasized natural biomechanics, continuous cutting motion, and decisive offensive
        action, often practiced from horseback as well as on foot.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern HEMA Instruction</h3>
    <p>
        In modern historical study, shashka fencing focuses on flowing drills, cutting
        precision, and momentum control. At HSS, instruction highlights the contrast between
        shashka mechanics and Western sabre systems, illustrating divergent technological
        solutions to similar cavalry problems.
