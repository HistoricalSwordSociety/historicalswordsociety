                    <h2>Preservation, Restoration & Conservation</h2>

<h3>Preservation Before Restoration</h3>
<p>
  The primary goal in caring for antique swords is preservation, not restoration.
  Original surfaces, patina, tool marks, and wear are part of an artifact’s historical
  record. Removing these elements can permanently reduce both scholarly and cultural value.
</p>
<p>
  Intervention should always be minimal, reversible where possible, and undertaken only
  when necessary to halt active deterioration.
</p>

<h3>When to Clean — and When Not To</h3>
<p>
  Cleaning is appropriate only when it serves to stabilize the object. Loose dirt,
  active red rust, or corrosive residues may justify careful cleaning. Stable dark patina,
  light discoloration, or age-related wear should generally be left untouched.
</p>
<p>
  Aggressive polishing, sanding, wire brushing, or power tools should never be used on
  antique blades. These methods destroy surface detail, alter geometry, and erase historical
  evidence.
</p>

<h3>Rust Identification and Safe Removal</h3>
<p>
  Not all rust is equal. Active red or orange corrosion indicates ongoing metal loss and
  should be addressed. Dark, stable oxidation may function as a protective layer and does
  not always require removal.
</p>
<p>
  Safe rust reduction techniques include controlled mechanical removal using wooden picks,
  soft brass tools, or fine abrasives under magnification. Chemical rust removers and acids
  are strongly discouraged due to their unpredictability and long-term damage risk.
</p>

<h3>Protective Coatings and Waxes</h3>
<p>
  After cleaning, metal surfaces should be protected from moisture and oxygen. Microcrystalline
  waxes are widely used by museums and conservators because they are stable, non-reactive,
  and reversible.
</p>
<p>
  A thin, hand-applied layer of microcrystalline wax—such as Renaissance Wax—can be gently
  buffed to form a protective barrier. Excess product should be avoided; more is not better.
</p>

<h3>Storage and Display Considerations</h3>
<p>
  Improper storage is a leading cause of corrosion and material degradation. Swords should
  be stored in environments with stable temperature and humidity, avoiding basements,
  attics, and exterior walls.
</p>
<p>
  Display mounts must support the sword evenly and avoid pressure points. Leather, wood,
  and textiles should be monitored for drying, cracking, or acidic decay that can transfer
  to metal components.
</p>

<h3>Scabbards and Organic Materials</h3>
<p>
  Scabbards are integral historical components and require care equal to the blade itself.
  Leather scabbards are particularly vulnerable to drying, mold, and acidic breakdown.
</p>
<p>
  Swords should not be stored long-term inside leather scabbards unless environmental
  conditions are carefully controlled. Periodic inspection is essential to prevent hidden
  corrosion and material damage.
