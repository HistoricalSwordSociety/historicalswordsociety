              <h1>About the Historical Sword Society</h1>
            </header>

            <p>
              The Historical Sword Society is dedicated to the research, preservation, and practical understanding of European sword traditions.
              We approach the sword not as a sporting abstraction, but as a historical artifact—shaped by culture, metallurgy, doctrine, and lived experience.
              Our work bridges academic study and disciplined physical practice to better understand how swords were designed, carried, and used across history.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Our mission is to preserve the art and science of the sword through rigorous study, responsible handling of historical artifacts,
              and historically informed practice rooted in primary sources. We seek to document, analyze, and teach European sword traditions
              with respect for their historical context and technical realities.
            </p>

            <h2>What We Study</h2>

            <h3>Historical Research &amp; Treatise Study</h3>
            <p>
              We study original fencing treatises, military manuals, and historical texts to understand the technical systems and philosophies
              that governed sword use in their own time. Emphasis is placed on source fidelity, comparative analysis, and contextual interpretation
              rather than modernized reconstruction.
            </p>

            <h3>Sword Collecting &amp; Artifact Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              Original swords are primary sources. We examine antique blades to understand form, balance, metallurgy, wear patterns, and construction techniques.
              This hands-on analysis informs our interpretation of historical texts and helps ground theory in physical reality.
            </p>

            <h3>Practical Fencing &amp; Training</h3>
            <p>
              Practice is conducted as a method of inquiry, not competition. Techniques are tested through controlled, structured drills informed by historical sources.
              Safety, accuracy, and technical intent take precedence over sport-oriented rule sets or modern performance metrics.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>
              The Society operates at the intersection of scholarship and practice. We prioritize primary sources, artifact-driven research,
              and careful experimentation. Collaboration with collectors, researchers, and practitioners allows us to refine interpretations
              and document findings for broader educational use.
            </p>

            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
            <p>
              The Historical Sword Society exists for historians, collectors, martial artists, educators, and serious enthusiasts who seek a
              deeper, historically grounded understanding of the sword. Whether your interest lies in archival research, artifact preservation,
              or historically informed practice, the Society provides a structured framework for study and exchange.
            </p>

            <p>
              Together, we work to preserve the legacy of European swordsmanship—one technique, one artifact, and one source at a time.
            </p>
